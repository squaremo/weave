# Preparation

## Get the new version number from the most recent tag

# Sanity checks

## Check that the version doesn't already exist by looking at github
## releases

## Check that the top changelog entry is this version

# Build and test

# Clone the repo at the tag, inject the version numbers, build
# distributables (library versions?)

# Run tests with the distributables, including version check

# Publish

# Either leave the distributables in a directory for the dev to
# upload, or upload them automatically?
